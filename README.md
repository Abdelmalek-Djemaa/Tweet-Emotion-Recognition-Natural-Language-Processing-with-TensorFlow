## Overview
This project implements a recurrent neural network (RNN) using TensorFlow to classify emotions in tweets. It tackles a multi-class classification problem in natural language processing (NLP), where each tweet is categorized into one of six emotions.

## Learning Objectives
- Utilizing TensorFlow for NLP tasks such as text classification
- Implementing a Tokenizer for text preprocessing
- Handling sequence padding and truncating
- Building and training a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
- Understanding the basics of optimizing RNNs for text classification tasks

## Dataset
The dataset consists of thousands of tweets labeled with six different emotions:
- Joy
- Sadness
- Fear
- Anger
- Surprise
- Love

## Requirements
- Python
- TensorFlow
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit learn
- Google Colab

## Getting Started
1. Open the Google Colab notebook:
   [Link to Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Abdelmalek-Djemaa/Tweet-Emotion-Recognition-Natural-Language-Processing-with-TensorFlow/blob/main/Tweet_Emotion_Recognition.ipynb)

2. Ensure you have the required dataset. You can upload the dataset from the github repo
    [data set] (https://github.com/Abdelmalek-Djemaa/Tweet-Emotion-Recognition-Natural-Language-Processing-with-TensorFlow/blob/b85fc4e58892c3e24659f97a036a7f6c270342ee/emotions.zip).

## Usage
1. Prepare Data:
   - Download the tweet emotion dataset and upload it to your Colab environment.
   
2. Run the Notebook:
   - Open and run the cells in the Colab notebook. The notebook will:
     - Preprocess the data
     - Train the RNN model
     - Evaluate the model
     - Generate predictions
   - The trained model weights will be saved within the notebook environment.

## Results
- Discuss the performance metrics and insights gained from evaluating the model.

## Future Improvements
- Potential enhancements or modifications to improve model accuracy or efficiency.
- Ideas for expanding the project scope or applying the model to other datasets.
